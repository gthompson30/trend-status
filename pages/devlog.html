			<p>
				Team Georgia Armenia Mauritania :: Gabriel Thompson, Maggie Huang, Anthony Chen <br>
				IntroCS pd06 sec10 <br>
				FINAL PROJECT -- TrendStatus : Is it Dead Yet? <br>
				SPRING 2021 <br>
				time cost: 16.7 hrs <br>
				collaborated with: N/A <br>
				consulted: QAF-Drops (Kevin Wang) <br>				
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3> Project Description: </h3>
			<p>
				TrendStatus uses Google Trends Data to analyze trend data of a random topic and assign it a medical status, for example:
				terminally ill, alive and well, hospitalized, six feet under, etc. The website allows you to search up a topic and gives
				you the medical status of that topic.
			</p>

			<h3> OBSTACLES OVERCOME </h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p>At first, we tried to scrape Google Trends data from the requests module.  We were unable to get requests working, because the filename was "requests.py", and this caused a "circular import" error, as the Python file was trying to import itself.</p></li>
				<ul>
					<li><p>This was eventually resolved naming the Python file something other than "requests", although we ended up using a dedicated module, instead of requests</p></li>
				</ul>
				<li><p>After trying and failing to use requests to scrape Google Trends data, we tried using multiple different Python modules, many of which were unusable because they spit out cryptic error messages we were unable to understand, required a Google account, or were otherwise confusing.</p></li>
				<ul>
					<li><p>We eventually found the Python library, pytrends, which allowed us to easily retrieve Google Trends data, with no cryptic error messages, and no requirement to sign up for a Google account.</p></li>
				</ul>
				<li><p>After we were able to load in data from Google Trends, we were initially unsure how to scrape the data for historical popularity, because the Google Trends data that pytrends retrieved was a variable type that was custom to the module.</p></li>
				<ul>
					<li><p>We eventually found that we could take the retrieved data, take the index of the trend we wanted to look at, and convert this to a list. The resulting list containing the raw data of the historical popularity, which we could analyze to calculate the appropriate medical condition</p></li>
				</ul>
				<li><p>We were initially unsure of how to analyze the popularity data and calculate a "positivity" or "negativity" to the data. We at first thought that we could compare the current data to the highest point, and make the score based off of that.</p></li>
				<ul>
					<li><p>We went through multiple different ideas for calculating the positivity of the graph, but eventually decided to make a list containing the slope between each item of the list. We then calculated the average of this list, and this average gave a pretty good numeric representation of the positivity of the graph.</p></li>
				</ul>
				<li><p>We originally didn't know how to make boxes to contain elements in HTML</p></li>
				<ul>
					<li><p>We figured out that we could use div tags to contain various other elements, and have backgrounds or separate properties for those elements.</p>
				</ul>
				<li><p>When setting up main.py, we were unable to import our trends.py file (which we had originally coded to calculate popularity of a searched topic). Thus, we ended up moving the function in the file (status('term')) to the main.py file. However, that was when we found out that it was the pytrends module we were unable to import</p></li>
				<ul>
					<li><p>At first, Gabriel Thompson created a web server on his machine to process status('term') instead and our code would just request the results from that. </p></li>
					<li><p>Eventually, Kevin Wang helped us and we were able to import the pytrends module by moving the downloaded pytrends module to our final project folder instead of the local library.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			
			<h3> UNRESOLVED ISSUES </h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Some CSS is outdated when run in Chrome, not sure why.</p></li>
				<li><p>The website program was unable to write to files, and yielded "permission denied" errors. How would we fix this?</p></li>
				<li><p>In order to use pytrends, we have to put the entire module in the same folder as the website. How could we import pytrends without doing this? More information: <a href="https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/stuy.edu/g/introcs-mykolyk-20rona21/c/mPfA-izzJcA">https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/stuy.edu/g/introcs-mykolyk-20rona21/c/mPfA-izzJcA</a></p></li>
				<li><p>We aren't sure how we could make our algorithm for analyzing the Google Trends data better. We have, however, found a tutorial that uses pandas to analyze data trends, which we might implement later: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-analysis-in-python-an-introduction-70d5a5b1d52a">https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-analysis-in-python-an-introduction-70d5a5b1d52a</a> </p></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3> COOL STUFF LEARNED </h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p>We've learned how to retrieve Google Trends data in Python, using the pytrends module</p></li>
				<li><p>We've learned how to measure whether a trend is general positive or negative using slopes (although this was not used in the final project)</p></li>
				<li><p>We've learned about how to separate different parts of a webpage with div tags</p></li>
				<li><p>We've learned about how to use hr tags to make dividers on HTML pages</p></li>
				<li><p>We learned how to make a progress bar and change the various elements of the bar.</p></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3> MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES </h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p>We initially planned on doing the project on the analysis of specialized high school acceptance data to determine the chance someone from a specific middle school would be accepted. This idea was replaced with the analysis of GoogleTrends data to find how relevant a topic is.</p></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3> LESSONS LEARNED </h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Make sure the name of the file you are working on is not the name of a module you may need.</p>
				<li><p>If you need to download a module to make a certain function work but the code needs to be able to be run by everyone, move the downloaded module folder to the same folder as your work so it can be accessed.</p></li>
				<li><p>Shadows are very picky. Here's a short summary of factors to consider: the color of your text, the color of your shadow (making all shadows black is both tacky and unrealistic), how offset your shadow is from your test, how blurred your shadow is, etc. The best way to make a good shadow is a dark -light combination : light text with dark shadow or the opposite. Never not offset the shadow and just blur because that leads to tackiness (unless you blur it very far and that's the effect you are looking for.) Also, color combinations with the rest of your page also matter. Some colors clash and having colors that are too close makes the page look off. The best way is just to mess around with the shadows a lot but these are the basic rules to consider.</p></li>
